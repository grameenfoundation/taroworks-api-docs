# TaroWorks API Documentation

This repository contains swagger and POSTMan documentation for the TaroWorks API. As we update the API, we'll put updated specs here.

# Swagger

Navigate to https://grameenfoundation.github.io/taroworks-api-docs/#/ to see the latest version of swagger.

# POSTMan

You'll need to import both the Tests and the Environment files from the postman folder into the POSTMan app. Fill out the environment variables with the relevant salesforce information (username, password, Security token, client secret, etc.).
